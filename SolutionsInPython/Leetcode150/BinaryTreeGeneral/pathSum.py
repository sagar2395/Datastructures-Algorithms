# 112. Path Sum
# https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

# Example 1:
# Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
# Output: true
# Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

# Example 2:
# Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
# Output: false
# Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
# (1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
# (1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
# There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

# Example 3:
# Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
# Output: false
# Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
