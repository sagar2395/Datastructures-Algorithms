# 210. Course Schedule II
# https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

# Example 1:
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

# Example 2:
# Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
# Output: [0,2,1,3]
# Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
# So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

# Example 3:
# Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
# Output: [0]
