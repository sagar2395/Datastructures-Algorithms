# 133. Clone Graph
# https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

# Example 1:
# Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
# Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
# Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
# 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
# 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
# 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
# 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

# Example 2:
# Input: adjList = [[]]
# Output: [[]]
# Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
