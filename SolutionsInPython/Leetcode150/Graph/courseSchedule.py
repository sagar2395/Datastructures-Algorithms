# 207. Course Schedule
# https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

# Example 1:
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
# Output: true
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
# To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

# Example 2:
# Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
# Output: false
# Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
# To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
