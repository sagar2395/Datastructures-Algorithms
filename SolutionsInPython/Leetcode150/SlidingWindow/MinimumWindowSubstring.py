# 76. Minimum Window Substring
# https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
# Output: "BANC"
# Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "a", t = "a"
# Output: "a"
# Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

# Example 3:
# Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
# Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
