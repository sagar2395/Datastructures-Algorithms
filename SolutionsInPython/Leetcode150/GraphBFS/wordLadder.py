# 127. Word Ladder
# https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150

# Example 1:
# Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

# Example 2:
# Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
